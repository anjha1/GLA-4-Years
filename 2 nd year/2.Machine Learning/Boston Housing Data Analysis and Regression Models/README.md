# Boston Housing Data Analysis and Regression Models

This repository demonstrates a step-by-step approach to performing data analysis and regression 
modeling on the Boston Housing dataset using Python. The project covers various machine learning 
techniques and preprocessing tasks such as imputation, outlier detection, and feature scaling, 
along with multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Stochastic 
Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor.


# Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, outliers, and scaling features.
Correlation Analysis: Visualizing relationships between input and output variables.
Regression Models: Implementation of Simple Linear, Multiple Linear, Ridge, and SGD Regressors.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and cross-validation.
Encoding Techniques: One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding for categorical variables.
Voting Classifier: Combining Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN for classification.



This project provides a comprehensive workflow from data loading to model evaluation, 
making it a valuable resource for learning regression and preprocessing techniques.
